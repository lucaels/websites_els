abstract = "Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in how management controls operate together as a package of interrelated mechanisms. This study contributes to this literature by focusing on a single industry in one country, and addressing controls in medium-sized enterprises (MEs). The study explores how accounting and other forms of control commonly combine in this setting, and the associations these combinations have with firm context. From a cross-sectional sample of 242 firms the data shows that MEs in the studied industry used two different control configurations. One group of firms placed a relatively strong emphasis on most studied controls, except for centralization of decision-making and strong hierarchy, whereas the other group relied on centralization and places less emphasis on other controls. Size, task programmability, outcome measurability, complexity in terms of extensiveness of product range and environmental unpredictability can predict the configuration in use."
